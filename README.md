MaticShare is a smart contract running on the decentralised Polygon Blockchain and does not belong to any individual person or business enterprise. It's purpose is to distribute the MATIC cryptocurrency token evenly between all users of the smart contract. The distribution is controlled by the smart contract algorithm ~ which is immutable, uncontrollable and unstoppable!

The site administrators DO NOT own the MaticShare project and have no technical or any other means to access user funds which are ALWAYS sent direct to users wallets P2P (Person 2 Person).
